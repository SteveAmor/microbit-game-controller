# The micro:bit game controller

## Objectives

- Understand that two devices can send data to each other using serial communication.
- Understand that Python and Scratch can communicate with each other.
- Implement a MicroPython program to read accelerometer data from the micro:bit.
- Relate accelerometer data to the motion of sprites in Scratch.
- Experiment with physical inputs, to implement new behaviours of sprites.

## Software installation

For this lesson, your students will need access to the **mu** IDE. To install mu, open the terminal on the Raspberry Pi and type:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mu -y
```

They will also need the Python Scratch library. You can install this by typing the following into the terminal:

```bash
sudo pip3 install --pre scratch
```

## Hardware requirements

For this lesson, your students will need access to the following hardware:
- Raspberry Pi
- BBC micro:bit
- USB A-to-micro-B
